    <string name="title3">How YesGraph Works</string>
    <string name="description3">YesGraph learns the patterns in your app automatically using past
        successful invitations to train a filter. We extract features about what kind of relationships
        and people are good for your app.\n\n
        What mightwe look for? Here are some examples.\n\n
        Phone number area codes contain some location information, and some apps send invites to people in your same town.\n\n
        B2B apps often involve collaboration with coworkers, so having the matching email domain matters.</string>
